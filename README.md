# micro-blog

Plug-in theme for Micro.blog that uses simple.css.

Forked from "Simple Theme" by @manton.

I did nothing but edit the .css file.

## Instructions

- On micro.blog/Design, install and enable `Simple Theme`.
- Create a custom theme and call it `BnP`.
- Select this GitHub repository.

That should do it. But if not, overwrite the .css file in the custom theme with the one in this repository.
